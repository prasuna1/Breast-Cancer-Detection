# Breast-Cancer-Prediction Using Machine learning Algorithms
This project aims to predict whether a person has breast cancer or not using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing various features extracted from breast cancer data, the models implemented in this project can provide accurate predictions, which can aid in early detection and prompt medical intervention.
